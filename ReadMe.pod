=head1 SYNOPSIS

From the command line:

    > pkg help

    > pkg new \
        --from=pkg/perl/dzil \
        --module=Foo::Bar \
        --desc='Foo to the Bar' \
        foo-bar-pm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<pkg> is your tool for creating distributable, modular packages, in a variety
of programming languages. Perl 5 modules for CPAN, Python modules for PyPI,
Ruby modules for RubyGems, etc.

In truth, pkg is nothing more than a simple way to create a new directory of
starter files, by applying a set of configuration information to a set of file
templates. The information is all completely in your control. You can use
other people's templates or create your own.

=head1 QUICK START

Here's the quick and simple way to get started, assuming you are familiar with
L<cpanm> and C<git>. From the command line:

    # Go to the directory where you keep your repos:
    cd $HOME/src/
    # Get the base pkg directory:
    git clone https://github.com/ingydotnet/pkg-pkg.git pkg
    # pkg/README will contain a list of known pkg template repos
    # Get a basic pkg template. In the case, for a Perl module:
    git clone https://github.com/rafl/perl-pkg.git pkg/perl
    # Maybe get a more specific Perl module template:
    git clone https://github.com/rafl/perl-dzil-pkg.git pkg/perl/dzil
    # Edit the conf files appropriately
    edit pkg/pkg.conf pkg/perl/pkg.conf pkg/perl/dzil/pkg.conf
    # Now create a new perl module in the foo-bar-pm directory
    pkg new --from=pkg/perl --module=Foo::Bar --desc='Foo Bar' foo-bar-pm
    # Make another new module!
    pkg new --from=pkg/perl/dzil --module=Bar::Bar --desc='Bar Bar' bar-bar-pm

That was easy.

=head1 TEMPLATES

The main template repository is: L<https://github.com/ingydotnet/pkg-pkg.git>

The README in this repo contains repos for many other repos. You can easily
create your own too. Just make sure there is a C<pkg.conf> file in each
template dir (even if it is empty). Template directories inherit from their
parent directory.

More doc soon.

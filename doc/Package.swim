The Acmeist Module Package Management Tool

<badge travis coveralls ingydotnet/package-pm>

= Synopsis

From the command line:

  > pkg help

  > pkg new \
      --from=pkg/perl/dzil \
      --module=Foo::Bar \
      --desc='Foo to the Bar' \
      foo-bar-pm

= Description

`pkg` is your tool for creating distributable, modular packages, in a variety
of programming languages. Perl 5 modules for CPAN, Python modules for PyPI,
Ruby modules for RubyGems, etc.

In truth, pkg is nothing more than a simple way to create a new directory of
starter files, by applying a set of configuration information to a set of file
templates. The information is all completely in your control. You can use
other people's templates or create your own.

=head1 QUICK START

Here's the quick and simple way to get started, assuming you are familiar with
[cpanm] and `git`. From the command line:

  # Go to the directory where you keep your repos:
  cd $HOME/src/
  # Get the base pkg directory:
  git clone https://github.com/ingydotnet/pkg-pkg.git pkg
  # pkg/README will contain a list of known pkg template repos
  # Get a basic pkg template. In the case, for a Perl module:
  git clone https://github.com/rafl/perl-pkg.git pkg/perl
  # Maybe get a more specific Perl module template:
  git clone https://github.com/rafl/perl-dzil-pkg.git pkg/perl/dzil
  # Edit the conf files appropriately
  edit pkg/pkg.conf pkg/perl/pkg.conf pkg/perl/dzil/pkg.conf
  # Now create a new perl module in the foo-bar-pm directory
  pkg new --from=pkg/perl --module=Foo::Bar --desc='Foo Bar' foo-bar-pm
  # Make another new module!
  pkg new --from=pkg/perl/dzil --module=Bar::Bar --desc='Bar Bar' bar-bar-pm

That was easy.

= Templates

The main template repository is: https://github.com/ingydotnet/pkg-pkg.git

The README in this repo contains repos for many other repos. You can easily
create your own too. Just make sure there is a `pkg.conf` file in each
template dir (even if it is empty). Template directories inherit from their
parent directory.

More doc soon.
